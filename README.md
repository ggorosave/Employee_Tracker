## Description
Most businesses need a way to keep track of their employee data. The Employee Tracker is a content management system that uses an SQL database to store and retrieve data. It offers a clean simple CLI interface to view tables displaying data on departments, roles, salary, managers, and employees. The employee tracker further offers the user to input data to add new departments, roles, or employees. This project utilizes JavaScript, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), [mysql2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2), [inquirer 7.0.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer), [console.table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table), and [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).
